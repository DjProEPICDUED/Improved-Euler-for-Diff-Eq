# Improved-Euler-for-Diff-Eq
Calculates the final y value using the improved Euler method after you input the x you want it to reach, the step (h), y0, x0, and manually add the diff. eq. in the code. Starts with step size h, and then use successively smaller step sizes until successive approximate solution values at x_final agree rounded off to the decimal places you want.
